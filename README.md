## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the development of the Shopify theme, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Shopify development store or a valid Shopify account.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with Liquid, Shopify's templating language.
- An understanding of responsive web design principles.
- Access to a code editor of your choice.

With these prerequisites met, you're ready to dive into the exciting world of Shopify theme development!

## Contribution Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. For a better development experience, I suggest setting up tools and packages with the same [versions](#versions-of-tools-and-packages).
4. Create a file named `variables` in the root of the project directory. Remember, it should have no extension. Paste the same code from the `variables.example` file and replace it with your own variables.
5. Use the `--vars` flag in any command to provide a path to a file for loading variables.
6. If you use `yarn` as your node package manager, do not delete or change the `.yarnrc.yml` file. However, if you use another package manager, you don't need the file.
7. Invoke `theme watch` in the terminal after setting up your development environment.
8. Make changes, and then create a pull request.

## Usage

To use the theme:

1. Download the `zip` file from GitHub.
2. Upload it to your own store.
3. That's it!
